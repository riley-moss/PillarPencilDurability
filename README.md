## Requirements
Please see https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability for more in-depth description of Kata.

#### Build a functional Pencil that is able to write, erase, and edit. The Pencil point and eraser also degrade like a real pencil.
I tested using TDD ideologies and used JUnit functions as the basis.
